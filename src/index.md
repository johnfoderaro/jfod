Hello, I'm a JavaScript developer from New Jersey, who specializes in sider-side JavaScript and the Node.js ecosystem.

I also find writing to be a fun hobby, particularly technical writing. Check out my [blog](/blog), learn more about some of my recent [projects](/projects), or [contact me](/contact) directly.
