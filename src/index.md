Hello! I'm a JavaScript developer from New Jersey, who specializes in engineering solutions within the Node.js ecosystem, with a concentration on server-side JavaScript. And while I enjoy spending my time on a Linux server, I'm certainly no stranger to the browser.

Check out some of my latest open source [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/johnfoderaro), read my [blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@JohnFoderaro/latest), or [contact me](/contact) with any questions, comments, or just to say hello.

*Cheers!* üçª
