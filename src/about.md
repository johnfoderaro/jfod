# About

My name is **John Foderaro**. I am a full stack web developer from New Jersey with an emphasis and passion for server-side JavaScript, the Node.js ecosystem, and Linux.

I'm a huge JavaScript nerd, and generally gravitate toward using this language for many programmatic tasks and projects (I know, use the right tool or language for the job). But, being a web developer, and loving the quirks and intricacies of the de facto "language of the web", JavaScript is always one of my favorite languages to code with as it works so seamlessly both client-side and server-side.

I find that writing is a fun hobby, particularly technical writing that involves precision and great detail -- all while remaining as concise as possible. With Digital Shore, my goal has always been to write as many tutorials, guides, and thoughts around web development as possible. However, quality always supersede quantity, therefore, I do not rush to publish posts for the sake of publishing posts.

## Professional Experience

### Web Developer

#### Back-End

- Node.js evangelist and soon-to-be ninja
- Lover of all things Linux and the command line
- Still a fan of Apache ðŸ˜Ž

Oh, the back-end. The server. My home. This is my favorite area to focus my time and efforts around, writing code that's executed on the server. I'm a huge Linux fan -- specifically Ubuntu -- and I'm fully capable of working exclusively in the command line to setup items as applications and programs, users, websites, remote repositories, ssh keys, web servers, and also in maintaining and updating the server and various packages, programs, and applications -- GUI be damned.

#### Font-End

- Fully knowledgeable in semantic HTML and CSS
- Fluent with Bootstrap and other related frameworks
- No stranger to jQuery and the usual DOM manipulation
- Fully aware of web standards and best practice
- Experienced with CMSs such as Joomla, WordPress and Drupal

Of course, the front-end and client side deserves some love, too! I'm totally fluent with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. I've just recently began exploring front-end JavaScript frameworks and libraries outside of jQuery to keep my skills sharp. Thankfully, it's all JavaScript, so they're easy to pick up.

#### Programming and Language Skills

- JavaScript
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- Jade

#### Development Tools & Utilities

- Fully capable of setting up local dev environments (both Mac & PC)
- Capable GitHub collaborator and contributor: [@johnfoderaro](https://github.com/johnfoderaro)
- Static site generator enthusiast and advocate (Jekyll!)
- Experienced with npm, Grunt, Gulp, and Bower
- Huge fan of CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS

## Teams and Organizations

### Marathon Data Systems: 2010 - 2013

In 2010, I began my professional career as a website administrator working in the agency-style marketing department at Marathon Data Systems, a small-sized software company in central New Jersey. I quickly progressed to web designer and eventually began learning the fundamentals of SEO. My duties included designing and developing websites as well as executing SEO campaigns and strategies for small-to-medium B2C clients.

### NBC Universal: 2013 - 2014

By early 2013, I was ready for a new challenge and chapter in my life. I left my humble beginnings in suburbia to pursue a position in Manhattan with NBC Universal. My new role was in-house SEO Specialist and I oversaw all SEO efforts for the sites within their "News Digital" segment -- iVillage.com, TODAY.com, MSNBC.com and NBCNews.com. I worked closely with the editorial and technical teams, outlining comprehensive strategies to ensure SEO best practices were met.

In an instant, I went from working on sites that had ranged from a few pages to sites that now had up to and over one million pages. During my time in New York, I learned a _ton_ about technical SEO and just how important site structure and crawl-ability really is. Additionally, it was refreshing and insightful to shift gears and develop defensive SEO strategies as compared to my prior experiences and accomplishments.

### WorkWave: 2014 - Present

But, after a year and a half working in New York and having relocated to Northern New Jersey, my wife and I decided it wasn't the best long term fit for us. We relocated back to central New Jersey at the end of 2014. I was fortunate enough to pursue a web developer position within the corporate marketing team of my former employer -- now WorkWave (formally Marathon Data Systems). Things have gone nearly full circle for me, but the experience in New York has been one that I do not regret.

## Personal
On the personal side of things, I focus most of my spare time outside of my day job on web development projects, both front-end and back-end. I have been putting a lot of time and energy into managing and maintaining a few VPS running Ubuntu Linux for various applications and websites that I've created. I'm a huge fan of Node.js and love the fact that JavaScript can work so well on the back-end (so long, PHP!).

I'm also a big tech enthusiast (huge Apple nerd -- for better or for worse). But, I'm no stranger to all forms of computing technology, having built and administered plenty of Windows boxes throughout the years. I even swore by my Blackberry Bold 9700 up until summer 2012 when I finally hopped onto the iPhone band wagon. Other than the tech world, I love the ocean and enjoy surfing year round at New Jersey's beautiful beaches.
