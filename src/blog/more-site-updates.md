If you've been to Digital Shore over the past few months, you may have ran into a post from late November, 2015, related to an overhaul of the site. There, I listed reasons why I decided to use the [Poole framework](https://github.com/poole/poole) (well, a modified version of the Poole framework that borrowed heavily from one of themes built off of Poole: Lanyon).

Overall, I was pretty satisfied with how the site shaped up. But something felt as if it was still getting in the way of my words, in the way of my content. Something needed changing and updating. And for several weeks, I wasn't entirely sure what that something was until it clicked on a drive home from work one afternoon.

I decided to revert back to the fundamentals of the Poole framework. and abandon most of my changes to the general theme. Since Poole's very essence is to provide an uninterrupted and streamlined reading experience, why should I try and clutter things up? Goodbye header, bottom footer, and other styles and distractions that get in the way of the written word (and written code) that I pride myself with the most. Without these restrictions and distractions, the reader now gains exactly what they're looking for. Also, so long forced images as an "thumbnail" or preview to each blog post. I say forced because I literally had to force myself to create these things! Sure, it took like 5 minutes, but that's 5 minutes I could spend doing something else, like writing another awesome blog post!

Now that a second "re-design" (using that phrase very loosely) is done and released, what does Digital Shore actually have in store for 2016? Well, for starters, I want to write more on topics related to JavaScript, Jekyll, and generally speaking -- more simplified, yet efficient development workflows for web developers who stumble upon my blog. I also want to use Digital Shore as a means to showcase current projects that are public via GitHub, as I have been spending an abundance of time working on a few Node.js projects throughout February and March. So, be on the lookout for some cool stuff!
