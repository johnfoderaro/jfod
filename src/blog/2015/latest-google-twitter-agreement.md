During Twitter's fourth quarter earnings call on February 5th, 2015, CEO Dick Costolo revealed information around a new agreement between Twitter and the world's most popular search engine. Unfortunately, the details on this agreement are a bit sparse.

It's widely known that growing the user base has been a primary concern for Twitter ever since the company went public in late 2013. More users equates to an increase in potential ad revenue. What better way for Twitter to increase ad revenue than by striking an agreement with a search giant like Google?

This deal also helps Twitter in its goal of diversifying advertising products. But, more importantly, in helps Twitter in becoming:

>One of the top revenue generating Internet companies in the World

A goal stated by CFO Anthony Noto, as Twitter intends to reach a hypothetical goal of $14 billion in revenue by 2024.

Yet, something sounds all too familiar about this whole agreement.

## Didn't Google and Twitter Already Have an Agreement?

In 2009, both Twitter and Google had a similar partnership in place where Google was given access to Twitter's "firehose" of tweets. With this data piping directly to Google, the service Google Real-Time Search materialized, offering real-time information from Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and news websites. Once the deal with Twitter expired in 2011, this service went offline. What exactly lead to the decline of this first Twitter-Google collaboration?

To date, there has been no public explanation as to why the partnership ended after just two years. It's been widely speculated by the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-strikes-search-deal-with-google-to-surface-tweets-1423110651){:target="_blank"} and other sources that Twitter believed their original agreement with Google did not offer meaningful traffic or generate a meaningful amount of new users. Additionally, Twitter expressed concerns around whether or not their tweet data would be used to bolster the rival Google Plus platform.

After the end of the 2009-2011 agreement with Google, Twitter went public in late 2013. Since then, Wall Street has been very concerned with Twitter's slow growth.

## Twitter's Unsatiated Need for Organic Traffic

To help ramp up traffic, and in turn ramp up ad dollars and revenue, Twitter turned to the power of SEO. Back in November 2014, Twitter [shared information](http://searchengineland.com/twitter-seo-more-visitors-208160){:target="_blank"} on its renewed focus in SEO leading to a 10 time increase in search traffic. The change: making hashtag pages search engine friendly. Twitter explained that the changes to the hashtag pages increased the amount of logged-out users from 7.5 million per month to 75 million per month. For logged-out users, the call to action is to sign up to keep in touch with the latest trending topics.

With Twitter averaging about 6,000 tweets per minute, it can be tough for Googlebot to keep up with crawling, indexing, and ranking tweets (unless it attempts to crawl the site constantly, likely taking the site down in the process). To circumvent this issue, and further strengthen SEO efforts, Twitter is renewing Google's access to the tweet "firehose".

## How This Agreement Differs

Right now it's pure speculation as to what this agreement means, but it's believed by many experts in the SEO community that tweets will begin appearing in the normal Google SERPs.

The value proposition for Google is that it gains immediate access to time-sensitve content that can be indexed instantly, serving their users whenever a search is performed (Google is still a search company, right?). Of course the benefit to Twitter is more obvious, as it allows for tweets to appear directly in the SERPs, driving organic traffic.

With this soon-to-be organic traffic boon, Twitter is planning on putting its best foot forward in converting logged-out users into raving Twitter fans.

## What to Expect Next

The most prominent tweets will most likely be making their way into the SERPs, so expect things like breaking news or highly cited, trending topics, to appear before you see any of the usual Twitter banter.

Otherwise, it will be several months before we notice any influx of timely tweets in the SERPs, as Google and Twitter need to work out their behind-the-scenes infrastructure so data can be piped directly to Google. Hopefully by then some clearer details on this agreement emerge from either party.
