You've heard it before — that three letter acronym that represents one-part technical know-how, one-part marketing genius, and one-part intuitive voodoo magic to appease the search engine gods — Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, is the practice of having a website rank as high as possible in the search engine results pages for specific search queries. And over the past 10 years, interest in SEO has increased by 44% according to [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=seo){:target="_blank"}.

With an industry that seems incredibly popular and steadily growing, you’re probably wonder what it takes to become an SEO professional? Well, let’s find out below!

## The Traits of an SEO Professional

- Never Satisfied
- Front-End Savvy
- Analytical Rockstar
- Creative Thinker
- Great Communicator
- Thirst for Knowledge

### Never Satisfied
Is "good enough" never actually good enough for you? If so, then you're in luck, because this very same attitude is paramount to SEO success. The name of the game for SEO consists of essentially unlocking performance: taking content on a website and optimizing the keyword focus and keyword use, building links to bolster ranking efforts, and looking at and resolving technical issues that obstruct how a search engine bot crawls the site. For an SEO professional, having a website that is "good enough" isn’t actually good enough. It needs to rank. It needs to *perform*.

### Front-End Savvy
Knowing about keyword focus and how to best use keywords on a page is great, but having technical knowledge of how all the pieces work under the hood is extremely important. Knowing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other front-end web development skills makes you an even more lucrative SEO professional to potential employers. This front-end savvy lends itself very well to technical SEO: understanding and implementing canonical tags, managing XML sitemaps, configuring robots.txt, implementing pagination, understanding how JavaScript can impact what Googlebot can or cannot crawl, etc. These skills are a must have for any SEO professional.

### Analytical Rockstar
You're able to look at data and spot trends and patterns instantly. As an analytical rockstar, you have an innate ability to conceptualize how these trends and data can positively or negatively impact your overall metrics and goals. Having a site perform well is great, but identifying which areas and sections perform the best or worst offers valuable insight into an SEO campaign’s health. This valuable insight also allows SEO professionals to identify areas of opportunities. In addition, being well versed in digging through data to tell a story is a great skill to have as you’ll often times find yourself presenting the same data with a different spin depending upon your audience.

### Creative Thinker
Never being satisfied with "good enough", familiarity with front-end web development, and understanding how to think analytically are all great skills to have. But, being a creative thinker is actually what taps these skills. Creative thinking is the catalyst that unleashes the true potential of your skills and in turn takes SEO strategies to the next level. Without a knack for creative thinking, you won't be primed to out maneuver the competition and grow your organization or client’s website, and thus their business (and in turn your business or professional career).

### Great Communicator
Expressing your theories and strategies orally or written is a must for any SEO professional. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending upon the perspective), this field is not well established yet as compared to other disciplines within marketing. With that being said, many organizations or clients are not accustomed to the jargon and terminology used by SEO professionals, so be sure to always take your audience into consideration whenever communicating. What may be a common phrase amongst your peers and coworkers may sound totally foreign to a client or stakeholder within a different business unit — to the point where it may be so off-putting that these individuals may actually begin to doubt your abilities, thinking you’re only capable of spouting out buzzwords!

### Thirst for Knowledge
Since SEO is always changing, growing, and evolving, you'll want to have an appetite for knowledge. Keeping tabs on the latest techniques and emerging trends allows you to stay ahead of the curve. What was great for SEO years ago may no longer apply in 2015 (guest blogging, anyone?). Having this thirst for knowledge, coupled with the ability to retire old ideas and accept sudden change, happens to be wonderful traits for SEO professionals. This means, every time Google drops the hammer and changes the status quo, you’ll be on your toes, quick to react!

## Your Value as an SEO Professional
Now that you understand the traits many SEO professionals possess, it’s important to realize your value. Businesses, both large and small, completely understand the need of having a functional website in today's digital age. However, the surprise many businesses face is that having a website simply gets them a seat at the table, offering no guarantees of success.

Since there are so many considerations that need to go into ensuring that a website functions to its peak potential (design and user experience come to mind first, as they're the most glamorous), many times the less glamorous efforts in having a site rank within search engines and in turn drive traffic is often times overlooked. As such, many business are willing to pay top dollar to secure an SEO guru who can take their site from being a website to being a powerhouse.

## The Different Types of SEO Work
You have the traits and understand your value, but did you know there are essentially three types of SEO work out there?

- Agency
- In-House
- Freelance

### Agency
Agency style SEO work has you dealing directly with clients, customers, and stakeholders that are paying your organization to get the work done. For this role, be prepared to regularly interface with both internal and external team members as well as customers and clients alike. Clients can range in size from small mom and pop businesses to fortunate 500 companies depending upon the type of digital marketing agency you work for.

### In-House
As an in-house SEO, you're the organizations go-to SEO evangelist. You literally preach SEO day in and day out across all business units and stakeholders. You also handle all of the day to day SEO work that is needed for your organization's websites to succeed. For this role, be prepared to regularly interface with team members, other business units and stakeholders, and the occasional upper management and C-level executives depending upon your organization.

### Freelance
As a freelance SEO, you should already have had experience at an agency or as an in-house SEO, preferably both. This role can be the most challenging as you’ll need to play the role of SEO guru and entrepreneur. With freelancing as an SEO, you may often times find yourself in situations that feel very similar to both in-house and agency style work. Most of the time, your work may fall closer to the agency-side of the spectrum. For this role, be prepared to be the SEO guru your paying customers are looking for. Remember, as a freelance SEO, you’re not just selling your services, you’re also selling yourself and your personal brand.

## Where to Begin?
Now that you have an understanding of the skills required to become an SEO professional, as well as the different types of SEO work, you’re most likely wondering where to begin? LinkedIn is a great place to begin building connections. My best advice for the novice SEO who wants to turn professional is to build and develop as many connections as you can. From there, take the leap of faith and apply to any agency or in-house positions that meet your criteria for a job. If nothing sticks out immediately, use your social media networks to leverage freelance opportunities. It’s really surprising how many small business are out there have a website and literally have no idea how to unleash its true potential. If only they knew a freelance SEO…
