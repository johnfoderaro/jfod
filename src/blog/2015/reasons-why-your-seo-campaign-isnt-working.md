If you're staring at your analytics thinking to yourself -- ***why isn't this SEO campaign working!*** -- then you may be faced with one or more of these common mishaps:

## 1. No Clear Strategy or Goals

Many times a site is launched or an SEO campaign begins, but there isn't a clear strategy around which keywords to target and what results to anticipate after a certain time period.

In my experience, SEO isn't the type of inbound marketing strategy where you can just throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks because it takes a lot of time to gain any meaningful results. Instead of spitballing ideas and concepts for your SEO strategy, take action by casting a smaller net and setting reasonable goals and expectations from the very beginning.

For example, when it comes time to develop a strategy, don't go after a keyword like "widgets" right out of the gate (too big of a net). Instead, focus on "dark blue widgets for your kitchen" (smaller, more focused net). You'll be surprised how well you can gain traction when taking smaller, more calculated steps.

## 2. Poor Keyword Focus and Research

When developing an SEO campaign you have to make sure you're focusing on the right keywords. Don't stray too far away from your website's main focus. If you have a blog about "cooking gadgets", stick to cooking gadgets! Wait until you've become an authority in that niche to branch out into other larger categories.

Once you determine your main focus, begin researching keywords that you can target. Depending upon your domain's PageRank and how well you rank for existing keywords, you may want to start out with long-tail keywords (longer phrases), as they generally have a lower competition. There are many free tools out there that can help with keyword research.

A favorite of nearly every SEO is [Google's Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner){:target="_blank"}.

## 3. Lack of Original Content

What good is keyword research if there isn't any amazing content to back it all up?

If your site currently has a few pages of content, then keyword research can be a great tool to begin brainstorming ideas around what type of content to develop next. But, if your site just has a handful of articles that have no real focus, or worse yet, a handful of articles that are verbatim from another website, you cannot expect to rank with these pages. Search engines have very little incentive to reward websites that have poor content or duplicate content - **as it offers no value to the visitor**.

Your best approach is to scrap these junk pages and create new and original content that adds value. Content that is shareable and enjoyable to read and consume is great not only for bots but also for humans!

Remember, content should be created for the visitors reaching your site, not just for search engine bots alone.

## 4. Poor URL Naming Conventions & Linking Structures

Less is more when it comes to URL naming conventions. Short and memorable URLs tend to work best. Avoid adding too many directories to your URLs and also avoid the use of stop words like "the", "is", "at", "which", "on", etc.

If you're using a CMS, you may notice that some of your URLs have a very unique structure that may look something like:

`http://www.blog.com/index.php?p=2319/2/category6/index3/`

To avoid URLs like this, look for plugins specific to your CMS that can assist with URL rewrite functions. These types of plugins can make your URL's more SEF, or Search Engine Friendly, where you can replace these permalinks with something more keyword-centric and SEO friendly. Such as:

`http://www.blog.com/kitchen-gadgets/blue-blenders/`

The linking structure throughout the site is also an important factor as it can be a detriment to search engine bots if it hasn't been fully thought out ahead of time. Avoid having too many links per page, especially duplicate links. Also, don't pack your top navigation or footer full of links. Instead, make use of top level pages and ensure that most content is accessible by just a few links.

## 5. Lack of Technical SEO

1. Are you using schema.org markup for content?
2. Do you understand canonical tags?
3. Is your site using Rel Next and Rel Previous?
4. Have you considered a Sitemap? For video, images, and/or news, too?
5. Is both **www** and **non-www** resulting in a 200 Status Code?
6. Is your site registered and verified in Google Webmaster Tools?
7. Do you monitor Pages Crawled per Day vs Time Spent Downloading?
8. Are you monitoring for Server Errors and Not Found Errors?
9. Do you understand how 301 Redirects work?
10. Do you know about Robots.txt?

The list of technical SEO items goes on and on. It's very important to ensure your site's structure is built upon a sound foundation. Without the right site architecture, Googlebot and other search engine bots will struggle to find and index your content, resulting in sub optimal ranking.

## 6. Setting it and Forgetting It

SEO is a strategy that needs constant attention. It's no different than growing a garden. You can't expect to just plant some seeds (develop a website), water and fertilize it (add content), and then have it to grow (gain rankings) to the point where you can reap any rewards (earn leads and/or sell products from organic traffic). Instead, it needs constant love and attention.

If you develop a site and just throw up some basic content and then get upset that there aren't any results - well, you're doing it wrong! Nurture your SEO campaign and you will be surprised at what it can blossom into.

Be sure to regularly check your site's SEO health using [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/){:target="_blank"} or something similar.

## 7. Time

SEO is a *marathon*, not a sprint! If you have expectations or have set expectations with a client or business unit that there will be some measurable results within a few weeks, you need to take a step back and realize that there very well may not be any results for nearly 3-6 months.

With many ranking factors that can be controlled by an SEO, time is not one of them. It simply takes time to begin building a presence with SEO. There are many domains out there within your niche that have existed longer and have earned their ranking - why should you outrank them overnight?

The best approach to counter the issue of time is to ensure you lead into your SEO campaign with your best foot forward and that your website is firing on all pistons.
