As of January 2015, Bootstrap is still the most popular development project on Github with well over 75,000 forks and nearly 30,000 stars. But before attempting to understand what makes Bootstrap so special, let's first identify exactly what Bootstrap is.

## What is Bootstrap?
According to [GetBootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com){:target="_blank"}:

>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

Originally developed at Twitter, Bootstrap was designed to strengthen consistency amongst internal tools used by developers. It did exactly that and the original creators realized that they had developed a framework that was absolutely full of potential.

Bootstrap eventually went open source in August 2011 as a project on Github and has since become one of the most active open source projects in the world.

## That's Great - But What Makes it Special?

Bootstrap is special because it offers everything needed to jump-start nearly any web project. By offering a collection of preconfigured CSS elements and JavaScript plugins that scale efficiently for any device (thanks to a mobile-first philosophy), Bootstrap becomes an excellent choice for any and all types of designers and developers.

Bootstrap should not be confused with a template that's used with a CMS such as Joomla! or Wordpress. Instead, it's a full framework - a foundation - that offers a sound base to build upon.

There are several options to get started with Bootstrap -- ranging from downloading compiled CSS, JS and fonts, to the full source code available via download in a web browser or through Node based package managers like Bower or npm. Another neat tool is to select which components you'll need through the customization area of the Bootstrap website. This can save time sifting through the source code if you know that your project won't be utilizing certain JS plugins or CSS elements.

Of course this is just a cursory summary that glosses over what Bootstrap can offer for your web project. The real concern is whether or not it's right for you. Below is a list of 5 pro's and con's to Bootstrap to help you decide.

## Reasons to Use Bootstrap

### 1. It Saves **Lots** of Time

Work at a tech company, or any company for that matter, and you'll know that time is money. It's a clich√© idiom, but it holds true in so many different scenarios. Using Bootstrap can save lots of time as it offers a great foundation to begin building upon thanks to its robust grid system, preconfigured CSS elements, and JavaScript plugins. Why waste time reinventing the wheel when [the world's most active open source project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap){:target="_blank"} can offer instant gratification?

### 2. Superb Design Attributes and Consistency

The powerful grid layout coupled with predefined CSS elements and JavaScript plugins allow for consistency across all modern browsers and devices. Even older browsers will be able to display fully functional renderings of certain components, albeit lacking style or showing a different style.

One awesome aspect of Bootstrap is its support for [LESS](http://lesscss.org){:target="_blank"} -- a CSS preprocessor which allows making changes to the original source style incredibly easy. Through the use of variables and mixins, the general theme of any Bootstrap site can be fully customized without entering repeated rules. LESS allows you to adjust one item (like "Link Color") and have that change essentially built into an updated CSS file. This means no more repeating yourself updating several lines of CSS and no more reliance on the `!important;` rule to override properties.

### 3. Responsiveness Right out of the Box

The most current version of Bootstrap is fully responsive for any device right out of the box. This means that the same version of your website or web application can be served across desktop and mobile. No more mobile only sub domains to deal with and duplicate content issues to contend with on the SEO side of things. Instead, you have one version of your project that can scale gracefully across different resolutions thanks to preconfigured media queries within the default CSS.

### 4. Forward Thinking Framework and Philosophy

The framework is forward thinking thanks to its mobile first philosophy. And with that, it continues to drive the growth of future HTML and CSS standards. This is especially great in an era where mobile traffic is outpacing traditional desktop traffic as more folks are utilizing devices that rely on mobile friendly designs.

### 5. Backed by A Massive Community

Since it's open source, Bootstrap is constantly maintained and updated. There's a massive community behind it that offers countless resources for learning and problem solving. Additionally, there are many resources available that offer guidance around ideal workflows and methods to utilize advanced features like LESS.

## Reasons Against Bootstrap

### 1. HTML Can Get in the Way of the Content

There can easily be an overabundance of DOM elements full of classes with what appears to be never ending nesting upon nesting (not a bad thing, you should always nest your code!) Some front-end designers cringe at the amount of classes typical Bootstrap sites can contain. This can be problematic down the line in regard to scalability and maintenance depending upon both the size of your web project and the size of your team working on the project.


### 2. Difficulty with Existing Projects

Bootstrap can be a bit clunky to add and implement to an existing project or site that was built and developed on a different framework. Additionally, there are a ton of CSS elements and JS plugins that come with Bootstrap that just may not ever be utilized, resulting in a larger page weight.

### 3. It's the Same Thing!

There's countless sites out there built off of the Bootstrap framework that look nearly identical to one another. This may be a product of the modern web  or lack of front-end designers fully customizing and building their own theme. Thankfully this site itself doesn't look like it was built off the Bootstrap framework (/sarcasm).

### 4. Suddenly Everyone's an Expert
Surprisingly, there's an argument floating around the Internet where many front-end designers and developers feel that the Bootstrap framework can put them out of a job as it is allegedly so easy to use. Unless Bootstrap builds sites automatically, this claim is a bit over the top.

### 5. Tunnel Vision

Many times developers can find themselves stuck in tunnel vision thanks to this framework laying out so many preconceived elements. Instead of building new elements, developers may take the path of least resistance and rely upon an out-of-the-box style or solution. This in turn results in the issues described above in number 3.

## Weigh the Pro's and Con's

I find these sort of frameworks to be invaluable tools as a web designer and developer. Open source frameworks like Bootstrap help speed up the design process and allow for higher collaboration inside and outside of your organization thanks to Github and other social code sharing sites. Of course, while very flexible and modular, Bootstrap may not be the best fit for **every** single project, so be sure to weigh out the pro's and con's before moving forward.
