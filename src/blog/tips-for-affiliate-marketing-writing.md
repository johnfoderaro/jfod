If you're here then you probably have heard about affiliate marketing and how it can become a viable option to supplement your income. Many SEO's engage in affiliate marketing, simply because SEO works so well as an in-bound marketing method for this revenue stream.

The recipe for affiliate marketing success is simple and very straightforward: [build a website](/development/2015/01/31/bootstrap-pros-cons/) that offers value, leverage the fundamentals of SEO to gain visitors to your site, use your skills in Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) -- something many SEO's possess -- and watch the money roll in.

Overall, affiliate marketing driven by SEO is a fairly straightforward concept. If executed correctly, everyone wins.

One of the best mediums for affiliate marketing is the written word. Product and/or service reviews work incredibly well. These types of reviews generally fall into the following categories:

- Third party advocate for a product/service
- First party review of a product/service
- Comparison of products/services

No matter which path you choose for writing your affiliate marketing content, there really is no wrong approach. However, there are a few items that can trip up beginners at first. Let's take a look at these five tips below that'll help get you started:

## 1. Be an Expert Before You Begin Writing

Before you begin to even think about a highly focused niche to target, it's well worth your time and energy if you're already an expert *before* you begin. This means, you ought to be very well versed in offering true value about the subject. So, if you're a horrible cook, you're going to have a very difficult time finding the joy in owning, managing, and writing for your own website dedicated to the affiliate marketing of cookware. It's just a bad fit. Stick to what you know.

Once you sort through some of the things you're a real professional in and develop a short list, it's time to research and identify highly focused products and/or services within each category or niche.

**Pro Tip:** Already being an expert in the affiliate marketing niche you're writing about is a huge bonus. It means all of your content will be 100% unique, fresh, and original!

## 2. Focus on Extra Specific Niches

Some affiliate marketers get hung up on casting too wide of a net with what they're planning on targeting. Want to target consumer electronics? Be prepared to focus on just one highly specialized and specific niche, like "computer CPU coolers" or "computer case fans", or, even further and more specific -- "copper CPU heat sinks" or "120mm computer case fans".

Going too broad, to even something like "computer parts" in general, will yield poor results. The reason is that many of the affiliate partners already own this space and they own it very well. How do you plan to compete with companies like Amazon and NewEgg for very broad consumer electronic terms?

Choosing a highly focused niche can help not only build the authority of your website, but can also prevent you from dealing with the frustrations of casting too wide of a net due to a very broad focus.

**Pro Tip:** Focusing on too broad of a niche can be very difficult and can result in slow performance. Focus on the extra, extra specific goods or services. If you can take your idea and categorize it further, go as specific as possible.

## 3. Offer Actual Value to Your Visitors

Don't get caught up in the idea of just churning out poor quality content for the sake of having *some* content to begin ranking in the SERPs. Instead, focus on the value you're offering visitors. If your site is offering reviews, then actually review the good or service your site is speaking about! Offering a first-hand comprehensive review and critique is the exact value that visitors need when reaching your affiliate marketing site.

Sometimes simple text reviews aren't enough depending upon your niche. Don't be afraid to get creative with infographics, videos, comparison charts and more.

**Pro Tip:** Don't lose sight of offering value to your audience.

## 4. Don't Become a Salesman

You'll want to avoid sounding like a salesman when writing for affiliate marketing. Even though your ultimate goal is to earn a commission as a result of your content, the content still needs to provide value to your audience. If you're sounding too pushy or have too many call to actions or affiliate links jammed up in your articles, you'll end up turning visitors away.

Instead, try and stick to using limited, yet precise, call to actions throughout your content and your site. Do not try and overwhelm visitors with delayed JavaScript pop ups and other annoying "features".

**Pro Tip:** Sounding too sales-y can come off as pushy, causing an increase in bounce rate and, as a result, a drop in rankings.

## 5. Write For Humans First, SEO Second

Many people think affiliate marketing copy is written to benefit SEO and search engine bots only, with how it impacts actual human visitors being an after thought. Instead of stuffing your content with keywords, and in turn making it sound unnatural, focus on writing for and communicating to your audience. Remember, humans are reading your content and it needs to be coherent.

**Pro Tip:** Humans are visiting the site, reading the content, and ultimately clicking your affiliate links -- meaning, write your affiliate marketing content for humans, not search engine bots!
